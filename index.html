                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                    were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                    honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                        I was en EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a
                        transition and have heard some people who had an amaizing experience here. I signed up for
                        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                        weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                        successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                    Such a life-changing
                    experience. Highly

                    <q>
                        Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
                        I needed some structure from professinalswho can help me learn
                        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                        program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                        They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                        The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                        learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                        In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of
                        my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                        full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
